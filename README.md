## Introduction

In my second semester of college, I delved into the world of data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. This repository serves as a record of my journey in mastering these fundamental concepts. By working on programs related to linear search, binary search, matrix operations, linked lists, trees, and sorting algorithms, I gained practical experience in implementing and using various data structures and algorithms.

## List of Programs

1. Linear Search: Program to search an element in an array using linear search.
2. Binary Search: Programs using iterative and recursive methods to find an element in an array using binary search.
3. Matrix Operations: Program to perform matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose) using functions.
4. Static Stack: Implementation of a static stack data structure.
5. Static Queue: Implementation of a static queue data structure.
6. Linked List: Creating and performing operations (insert, delete, update, reverse) on a linked list.
7. Circular Linked List: Creating and performing operations (insert, delete) on a circular linked list.
8. Binary Search Tree: Implementation of a binary search tree with insertion and deletion operations.
9. Tree Traversal: Simulation of various tree traversal algorithms.
10. Bubble Sort: Implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
11. Selection Sort: Implementation of the selection sort algorithm.
12. Insertion Sort: Implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.
